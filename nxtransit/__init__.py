"""
NxTransit is a Python package designed for creating a multimodal graph representation of a public transportation systems. 
It uses General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to construct the graph and perform various time-dependent calculations.

Key Features:
- Multimodal Graph Creation: NxTransit can generate a graph that integrates different modes of transportation with street network.
- Time-Dependent Calculations: The package allows for the analysis of transit dynamics by considering the time-dependency of transit schedules. This includes calculating shortest paths with departure times, travel time matrices, and service frequency.
- GTFS Data Support: NxTransit uses GTFS data, a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information, as the basis for graph construction and analysis.
