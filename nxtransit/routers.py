    """
    Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a time-dependent graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : networkx.Graph
        The graph to search for the shortest path.
    source
        The starting node.
    target
        The target node.
    start_time : float
        The starting time.
    wheelchair : bool, optional
        If set to True, the algorithm will only use wheelchair accessible routes.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple containing the following elements:
            - list: The shortest path from the source to the target node.
            - float: The arrival time at the target node.
            - float: The travel time from the source to the target node.
            - set: The set of used routes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nt.feed_to_graph(feed)
    >>> path, arrival_time, travel_time = nt.time_dependent_dijkstra(G, "A", "B", 86400)

    Implementation
    --------------
    This function uses a priority queue to explore the graph with
    almost classic Dijkstra's algorithm. The main difference is that the
    delay between two nodes is calculated based on the ``current time``
    and the sorted schedules of the edge. The function also keeps
    track of the routes used in the path.

    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge("A", "B")
    >>> G.edges["A", "B"]["sorted_schedules"] = [
    ...     (10, 20, "route_1", None),
    ...     (30, 40, "route_2", None),
    ...     (50, 60, "route_3", None),
    ... ]

    So the edge from 'A' to 'B' has three schedules: route_1 departs at 10 and arrives at 20, route_2 departs at 30 and arrives at 40, and route_3 departs at 50 and arrives at 60.
    Internal function ``_calculate_delay`` will return the delay and the route for the next departure from 'A' to 'B' at a given time.
    i.e. if the current time is 25, the next departure is at 30, so the delay is 5 and time to arrival is 5 + (40 - 30) = 10.
