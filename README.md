# Transit

## Overview
This is a Python package developed for the integration of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data into NetworkX graphs, alongside OpenStreetMap (OSM) street data. It facilitates the construction and analysis of multi-modal transport networks, focusing on time-dependent routing and accessibility metrics. This tool is particularly suited for research in urban transportation planning, providing a simple framework for the analysis of dynamic transit systems.

## Features
- Loading GTFS data into NetworkX graphs
- Combining GTFS data with OSM street maps
- Performing time-dependent routing analysis
- Accessibility analysis based on various metrics
